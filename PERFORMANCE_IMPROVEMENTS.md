- **Examples**:
  - Feedback approval/rejection
  - Data loading errors
  - Authentication actions

### 3. Navigation Optimizations
- **LinkWithPreload Component**: Custom link component with optimistic navigation
- **Prefetching**: Automatic prefetching of likely-to-be-visited pages
- **Smooth Transitions**: Using React transitions for seamless navigation
- **DNS Prefetching**: Added DNS prefetch for external resources

### 4. Client-Side Performance
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, then syncs with server
- **State Management**: Efficient state updates with minimal re-renders
- **Refresh Functions**: Global refresh mechanisms for real-time data updates
- **Debounced Search**: Efficient search functionality with debounced inputs

### 5. Font & Asset Optimization
- **Local Fonts**: Switched to local font files for faster loading
- **Font Display Swap**: Implemented font-display: swap for better performance
- **Resource Hints**: Added preconnect and dns-prefetch for external resources

## ðŸ“Š Pages Improved

### Admin Pages
- **admin-feedback**: Added loading skeletons, toast notifications, refresh button
- **admin-predictions**: Enhanced with better loading states
- **admin-questions**: Improved user feedback and loading

### Staff Pages  
- **staff-dashboard**: Complete redesign with loading skeletons and real-time stats
- **staff-users**: Better search functionality and loading states
- **staff-predictions**: Enhanced display and navigation

### Main Pages
- **predictions/[id]**: Optimized with better loading states and smooth navigation
- **predictions**: Already server-side rendered (good performance)
- **Layout**: Enhanced main layout with modern navigation and loading states

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Performance Metrics Improved

### Load Time Improvements
- **Initial Page Load**: Reduced perceived load time with immediate skeleton display
- **Navigation Speed**: Faster page transitions with prefetching and optimistic updates
- **Asset Loading**: Optimized font loading and reduced external requests

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to all user actions
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with recovery suggestions
- **Loading States**: Progressive content loading with skeleton placeholders
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile

### Data Fetching Optimizations
- **Parallel Requests**: Multiple data requests executed concurrently where possible
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Cache Invalidation**: Smart refresh mechanisms for real-time updates
